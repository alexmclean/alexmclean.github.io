title: My blogging journey begins!
---

This is my first post on what is soon to be a blog full of cool tech tidbits and incoherent ramblings.

I created this blog to share my experiences of learning the ins and outs of web development, and provide myself an outlet to gush about all the cool nerdy stuff that I figure out.  

##Get Excited!

There will be much more to come, I wrote a few posts before configuring this blog and will add them in an order TBD.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
